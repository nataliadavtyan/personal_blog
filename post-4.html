                <h2>Footer at the bottom of a short page</h2>
                <p>On my shortest page, which is Contact, the footer had white space below it. It is not my first time facing this problem and I thought I knew how to fix this.</p>

            <article class="article">
                <h4>What caused the problem?</h4>
                <p>The reason is simple: there is not enough content on the page to push the footer to the bottom and therefore the space under it was left blank.</p>
                <h4>How was it fixed?</h4>
                <p>I remembered that on the course we were taught to use <span class="code">min-height: 100vh</span> that would stretch the container vertically and not leave any white space. I applied it to html but that was not it.<br><br>
                Then I googled my question and got an idea of using <span class="code">position: relative / absolute</span> on the footer and html, and not forgetting to set <span class="code">bottom</span> and <span class="code">left</span> to 0. It almost fixed everything but now the footer was on top of some of the content.<br><br>
                The last thing that I needed to do was setting <span class="code">margin-bottom</span> of the body to the height of the footer ( + some margin but it depends on the code).<br><br>
                Problem solved.</p>
