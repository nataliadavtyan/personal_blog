                <h2>Hyperfixating on the project</h2>
                <p>Learning to code and creating my own projects excite me so much that I forget to eat and five hours can easily pass like five minutes.</p>

                <h4>Why is it a problem?</h4>
                <p>While I find the ability to concentrate on something for a long period of time useful, I also find that forgetting about basic human needs is not healthy. In the process of building this project I missed some meals and spent too much time in front of the screen without breaks. This mostly happens to me during the solo projects.</p>
                <h4>What will I do?</h4>
                <p>I do not have a ready plan but I will try to incorporate short breaks more frequently. They can include getting a snack, making tea, spending some time with Michi (my flatmate's cat) or maybe breaking the day into morning and afternoon 2h sessions and going for a walk in between them. The most important thing in these breaks is not using any screens meanwhile.<br><br>
                The only rules that I already follow in order to avoid problems with sleeping and protecting my mental health are closing my laptop before 6-7 pm and not studying on the weekends, especially Sundays.
