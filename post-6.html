                <h2>Flexbox stretched my image</h2>
                <p>For the About page I applied <span class="code">display: flex</span> and my image turned from round shape to oval even though I set fixed height and width to it.</p>

            <article class="article">
                <h4>What caused the problem?</h4>
                <p>There are two items in this container: a round image and a text container. In the mobile version they are on separate lines, but when the window is wider, <span class="code">display: flex</span> is applied. As a result the image is vertically stretched.<br><br>
                Once the window becomes wide enough, the image also gets its shape back. The reason this happened is that the text was trying to get the space it needed and thus pushing the image for that extra space.</p>
                
                <h4>How was it fixed?</h4>
                <p>A lot of resources online suggested to apply <span class="code">align-self: center</span> to the image but it did not change anything. Then with the help of the Scrimba's community on Discord I was able to prevent the image from stretching.<br><br>
                Mist from Discord suggested to give the image <span class="code">flex-basis: 11.375em</span> (size of the image) and <span class="code">flex-shrink: 0</span>.<br><br>
                He also provided a great explanation to this: "The key here is the <span class="code">flex-basis</span> and <span class="code">flex-shrink</span> properties. <span class="code">flex-basis</span> is like saying "this is ideally the size I want. <span class="code">flex-shrink</span> is saying "this is the minimum amount to shrink it". By setting <span class="code">flex-shrink</span> to 0, you're saying, "If at all possible, DO NOT shrink this element"."<br><br>
                It worked.</p>
