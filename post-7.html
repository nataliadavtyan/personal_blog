                <h2>Things that I learned while coding this blog</h2>
                <p>I felt very excited to code this blog and apply my new knowledge about the responsive design, use grid and relative units. And this excitement didn't disappear, no. It's just that I faced some difficulties, which is very normal in coding. Here I would like to talk about them.</p>

                <h4>So, what is this solo project about?</h4>
                <p>My journey as a frontend developer started in summer 2022 and I am currently taking Scrimba's Frontend Developer Career Path which includes modules on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and some others.<br><br>
                This project is part of the module about responsive design. We were asked to follow the provided design on Figma and code a blog that will be adapted for mobile and desktop.</p>
                
                <h4>How did the process go?</h4>
                <p>It was my first time coding something with multiple pages and this made things more difficult. The projects I completed before were with a single HTML file. Here I had to create four types of pages that had some common design patters between each other and some that are completely different.<br><br>
                Initially I planned to finish the project in two days but here I am on my day 6 with the finished code and writing these articles.<br><br>
                So, the articles will be short. It will be useful for me to reflect on the things that I learned but not overcomplicate it.</p>
