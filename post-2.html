                <h2>More organised code</h2>
                <p>Making the code readable for other people and for myself in the future is important for working more efficiently.</p>

                <h4>How to make the code more readable?</h4>
                <p>As my codes get longer and longer I try to break them into categories. So my CSS would include typography, links, buttons, images, layout and media queries. This helps to quickly identify in which part of the code I need to find each element.<br><br>
                Another thing that I incorporated in this code is also commenting each group of the elements within these categories. If the code is not viewed daily, it is easy to forget where each heading is and what logic in the names of the classes was.</p>
                <h4>Was is helpful?</h4>
                <p>It was helpful, yes. I always knew exactly which part of the code I needed to edit. It helped me to save some time and made me less anxious.<br><br>
                But it's important to remember that anyone will be able to read these comments so keep it simple and only about the code. Unless you want a different effect.</p>
