                <h2>Planning before starting to code</h2>
                <p>This is my first project with multiple HTML files and not planning the process made me spend more time then I expected.</p>

                <h4>What happened?</h4>
                <p>This blog has 10 pages in total and 1 CSS file. The difficult part was carefully observing the provided Figma design file and finding similarities between objects and pages so they could be grouped together in one class.<br><br>
                What made things even more difficult is that mobile and desktop version have differences and I didn't observe them carefully as I was thinking about the mobile-first approach. As a result I spent six days coding this blog and constantly rewriting it.</p>
                
                <h4>What did I learn?</h4>
                <p>It is not something new for me but now I know where I need to pay more attention. As a person with a photography background I know that the speed and quality of a photoshoot often depend on how well I was prepared for it.</p>

                            <p>On my shortest page, which is Contact, the footer had white space below it. It is not my first time facing this problem and I thought I knew how to fix this</p>

                            <p>Learning to code and creating my own projects excite me so much that I forget to eat and five hours can easily pass like five minutes</p>
