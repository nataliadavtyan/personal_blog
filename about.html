                    <h2>Hi! My name is Natalia and welcome to my learning journal</h2>
                    <p>After several months of learning in the Scrimba's Frontend Developer Career Path I was able to create a 10-page blog and gained more confidence in my coding skills.</p>

                <h4>Why did I choose frontend?</h4>
                <p>Before getting into frontend development I was (and still am) a photographer, a publisher of a lifestyle magazine and a brand manager and some of my other interests are climate change and gender equality. I am passionate about seeing and changing the environment around me. Now I would like to collaborate with other people and build digital environment.</p>
                <h4>How did I know I would like coding?</h4>
                <p>At school I loved playing with numbers and had creative approach to problem solving at Math. Moreover, we had computer classes and sometimes we were programming a game within a programming game which I also enjoyed.<br><br>
                It was difficult for me in the beginning, especially with JavaScript, but the more I code, the more confidence I gain.<br><br>
                I am very excited to continue the course and learn more.</p>

                            <p>For the About page I applied display: flex and my image turned from round shape to oval even though I set fixed height and width to it</p>

                            <p>On my shortest page, which is Contact, the footer had white space below it. It is not my first time facing this problem and I thought I knew how to fix this</p>
